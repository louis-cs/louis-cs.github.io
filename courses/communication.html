            Communication is probably the most important pillar of IoT. The very essence of the field is to have a myriad of individual objects communicate to become much more than the sum of their parts ; This module explores the many aspects of IoT communication : communication protocols, networks, power usage and security.

          This lab was technically part of the protocols for connected object (if I am to trust the name of the course on our schedule), but it was very unique and independent from the other courses. The goal was to get a deeper insight into AM and FM demodulating, as well as show off the advantages of Software-Defined radio, as opposed to traditional hardware-defined methods.

      <p>
        Here, I will highlight all the experiences whose challenges had me looking for special ways to solve them. Some courses won’t be covered in this part, for different reasons: Energy for connected objects, since the course was almost exclusively lectures and had no graded deliverables, and Network Security for connected objects since most of the course is, to this day, still to come.
      </p>
      <h4>Protocols for connected objects</h4>
      <p>
        This course had many research deliverables on tight deadlines, which were a challenge in themselves. As much as it isn’t a scientific skill, they definitelly had me working on my organisational and time-crunching skills. The first report I had to deliver was about Narrowband IoT, a 5G technology using LTE bandwidths. I also produced a presentation on the Vehicule-To-Everything (V2X) technology for the 3G to 6G course, but I decided to focus on the third report in this part: The Wireless Sensor Network MAC protocols research report. The reason I chose this one is that it was individual while the other reports were made in groups, meaning the work could be divided. This report asked for a very in-depth analysis of pretty niche technology: the research was difficult, and had me compile information from a variety of scientific articles and cross reference information to come to my own conclusions. There were no shortcuts or people to lean on, and I had to mobilise all the research skills I had acquired over the previous years. My forte has also always been presentations, and having to write a scientific report on a tight deadline was a bigger challenge than just having to deliver a presentation.

      <div class="col-md-6">
      <p>
        This lab was pretty classic in the grand scheme of things, and was a welcome experience in this hectic semester. The biggest challenge it posed was the very thorough theoretical part: as a big farewell to academic mathematics, the first lab session was dedicated to theoretical Signal Processing, drawing from the mathematics courses of the same name I completed a few years ago. Although it took a while to get things running, this lab really showed that these old courses were not just water under the bridge, but stuck with me and gave me skills I’m able to use to this day. The technical part of this lab was very interesting, using GNURadio to process signals and demodulate radio emissions purely through software. Sadly, this year the labs were extremely late in the semester so I will not be able to link a report for this lab, as my notes for it are still on paper.

      <h4>Emerging networks</h4>
      <p>
        While we’ve only had half of the scheduled labs to this day, I feel the first lab was enough of a technical challenge to warrant its inclusion here. The object of this lab was to use Software Defined Networks (SDN) to illustrate the flexibility this technology offered over regular switches. The reason this course was a challenge for me was that although I came from a computer science background, I was studying abroad when most of the concept we used were taught, and I didn’t have all of the prerequisites. This is the course where I got the most information from my peers, as the network administration part of the lab was done in pairs, and it was one of the only courses that could be done on site during the pandemic. I managed to keep up with my peers through their help and my involvement, and all the concepts were much easier to internalise through practise.
        <br>
        I do not have any deliverables to join to this description though, as the course ended after the portfolio's presentation and was evaluated through an online quiz and an article analysis.

        <p>
          This module was particularly dense: not only was it comprised of an unusually large amount of courses, but they each had their lot of very technical lectures which were even harder to understand because of the remote classes. The self-evaluation process is also a little skewed for two reasons: the large amount of theoretical lectures makes self-evaluation hard, even if the deliverables were satisfactory: all the taught material wasn’t thoroughly tested. Secondly, part of the module ended after the portfolio’s presentation, so some skills (like security) I’ve evaluated based on my ongoing involvement in the course.
          <br>
          As far as the protocols and communication skills go, I feel like I acquired the skills the module intended to transmit. Though the lectures were very dense, the research assignments we were given early in the course meant the comprehension gaps could be filled. The different courses complemented each other well, and answered many of the questions the other lectures posed. I went from a very basic understanding of IoT communication protocols to an informed one, and I feel confident in my abilities concerning these technologies. I not only learned useful technical information, but deepened my research, scientific writing and presentation skills.
          <br>
          Concerning the security part of this module, I cannot confidently judge my abilities, as only a third of the courses have happened to this day. They are definitely a symptom of a bigger scheduling problem for this module, starting very late in the semester, with three of its six parts ending either a couple of days before, or after the portfolio presentation. This problem is surely linked to the pandemic’s scheduling obligations, but this issue linked to the harder to follow remote lectures kept me from going beyond the basic requirements of this module’s teachings.
