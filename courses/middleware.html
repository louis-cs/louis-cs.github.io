    <h4>Middleware for IoT</h4>
    <p>
      The middleware course had a series of lab who covered different middleware options for IoT, first starting with MQTT, a protocol based on the publisher-subscriber architecture. We then had an introductory lab focusing on the MangOH Yellow board and the Octave web platform, giving us ideas on how to use simple IoT systems. The final two labs were focused on the OM2M platform, which would come in handy for the Service Oriented Architecture project. The biggest technical challenge was learning new technologies, the architecture and nomenclature of every component, especially for OM2M. The biggest and most unexpected challenge though was that France entered lockdown in the middle of the labs, and the final labs had to be done remotely, and getting used to the new format and lack of appropriate hardware took a lot of energy which could have been used to focus on the technical aspects. I missed a few important OneM2M concepts, and didn't get to use the OM2M platform as much as I should have, which just put extra strain on the Service Oriented Architecture project and had me working twice as hard down the line. Despite everything, these labs were great to practise my learning capabilities, acquiring pretty good proficiency in a short amount of time.    </p>

    <h4>Service Oriented Architecture</h4>
    <p>
      The biggest challenge in this module by far was the Service Oriented Architecture OM2M project. The premise was very interesting, with a real world application: design an architecture to automate doors, windows, lights and heaters in INSA's buildings' rooms thanks to a network of sensors and activators. This very thorough project had us design an architecture, and implement the software using the OM2M platform. We defined a set of behaviours we wanted our actuators to have depending on the values picked up by our sensors. The technical implementation was greatly helped by the middleware course, since the last labs were dedicated to getting to use the OM2M platform. We managed to integrate it thanks to the OM2M Java library, since the entire project was developed in Java. One of the biggest obstacles in this project was how large the project was, and how easy it was to get lost. We had trouble initialising the project because we didn't know how to start, but by using this course's coupling with the Software Engineering course, we were able to take a step back, define shot term goals and develop web services that gathered sensor data and used actuators. A management system is implemented on another web service that users can interact with, and communicates with all the devices' web services. As I wasn't as proficient with the OM2M platform as my teammates, my biggest contribution were during the Agile planning phase, the architecture design and writing the report. This project was not only a great technical opportunity, applying our new skills to a potential real-life situation, but it also let every member of the group play to their strengths, which is one of the pillars of the ISS mentality.    </p>

      This lab was separated in two parts: the first one was all about virtualisation, and featured a pretty detailed theoretical study of virtual machines and containers. We tinkered with many technical aspects of these technologies: connectivity, resource sharing, snapshots and more. We then used Openstack to deploy a variety of virtual machines and create a virtual network to work on the network topology. We then implemented services (five sub-services of a calculator) to try to use our service with different configurations. The technical challenge was to get used to new technologies, and the user interface of high-level applications in the Openstack part. This lab gave us a great insight on how a good theoretical background (understand the difference between virtual machines and containers, or understand the different layers of a network's topology) remain useful, despite all the high level tools with easy to understand user interfaces developed for inexperienced users.

  <div class="row text-justify">

    <p>
      While this module has three courses, it felt like two parts: middleware on one side, and cloud computing on the other. The middleware courses were a great way to acquire both technical skills in deploying web services, learning different IoT architectures and architecture standards. The cloud computing course was pretty independent from the rest, but was very interesting because of how concrete all of the work was: we used tools we had already heard about because of their industrial and professional relevancy, like docker and openstack. all the skills I acquired in this course, being knowledge about virtualisation and cloud computing usage and network topology, felt like they would be useful in both my professional and personal life as a developer.
      <br>
      Sadly, I cannot confidently self-evaluate my OM2M implementation skills as the Expert level my computer science background dictated I should reach: the transition to distance learning and the intense workload of the later Labs and project were too much, and I had to rely on my teams to deploy the architecture. As much as I have advanced knowledge about these fields, I feel like I would need a bit more practise with these tools to consider myself an expert. These were still a great opportunity to utilise my other strengths, like my redaction and software engineering skills, and still be an important part of the team.
