          The more sensors, the more data. With an ever growing number of connected objects come an influx of information which can be used to make a smarter and safer world. However, large amounts of data mean nothing if they aren’t correctly processed: this module delves into the ways we have to analyse and process data to use it to its full value.

      This module was comprised of three courses, one of which was linked with another module. These three courses were pretty independent, but gave a good overview of the data processing and analysis fields.

    <h4>Software Engineering</h4>

        This course was intersected wit the Software Architecture class, and consisted of one lecture then a project. The goal was to apply the Agile Method to the Service Oriented Architecture Project.

    <h2><b>Technical Challenges</b></h2>
  </div>
  <div class="row text-justify">
    <h4>Software Engineering</h4>
    <p>
      As much as software engineering was a small part of this module, it posed the biggest technical challenge, considering the fact I expected it to be negligible. Because of the pandemic, the Software Architecture project’s progress was very chaotic, and we were not able to stick to the Agile Method. Our progress rate was extremely uneven, so advancement predictions were completely inaccurate. Even though the project was finished, it was through a couple of crunches rather than thought out planning.
      <br>
      However, this wasn’t an issue for me as all the software engineering skills this course was trying to pass on, I had already acquired during my semester abroad: During a two month-long development of complex software in a team of eight foreign students, we applied the Agile Method exactly, rotating through every role an Agile team member could occupy. My summer internship also used the SCRUM method, with daily meetings and careful planning. As much as I am disappointed I did not get to re-apply this skill this semester, I rest assured my software engineering skills are much more developed than were asked of me in this course.    </p>

  </div>
  <div class="h-divider"></div>
  <div class="row text-justify">
    <h4>Semantic Data</h4>
    <p>
      Coming from a computer science background, most of this course’s contents were covered by the fourth year program, so the labs didn’t pose too much of a challenge. However, applying these notions in an IoT context wasn’t trivial, and implementing an ontology in a different language than we were used to (Java in this case) was a bit tough. Because of overconfidence, I thought I had breezed through the lab only to realise at the end all of my test results were false positives because of an early mistake. There wasn’t enough time to correct everything, but thanks to a debrief at the end of the lab, I was able to understand my shortcomings and use this lab as a learning experience.    </p>

  <div class="row text-justify">
    <h4>Big Data</h4>
    <p>
      On top of having to learn a new language and adhere to strict redaction rules, the big data project had a pretty unique challenge: awful scheduling. Unlike the rest of the curriculum, scheduling sessions to work on projects, this course only had scheduled hours for tutorials, only notifying us that we would be evaluated on an important project that was to be done exclusively in our own time. Despite this, this challenge was surmounted thanks to how invested I was in it: getting to choose my own dataset to analyse and my own problems to solve was so interesting to me that I didn’t have an issue working on it during the christmas holidays. Tackling a whole new, pretty unique language in R was a skill I had acquired in my previous years in computer science, and I had to apply here on short notice. My curiosity ended up teaching me all the basics of data analysis, and through a lot of trial and error, I completed this project and its report.

  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4 text-justify">
      <p>
        The three courses in this module were self-contained, and the takeaways are different for each one. For Software Engineering and Semantic Data related skills, my self evaluation is based on both this semester’s work and my previous experiences.
        <br>
        In both Software Engineering and Semantic Data, I was already experience coming into the courses. Strangely enough, they are the ones for which I encountered the most hurdles: I was not able to deal with the pandemic’s unique conditions for software engineering, and my overconfidence made it so I couldn’t finish the semantic data’s second lab. In the end, these challenges were an opportunity, as I already had the skills the courses were trying to teach: instead of breezing through, I found an occasion to self-reflect on how to apply the skills I already knew, and made mistakes I will not make in the future.
        <br>
        For the Big Data course, the tutorial helped with a lot of issues related to learning R. They taught us just enough to get started on the project so that our personal research would give us the tools we were missing. This project showed me how much easier it is to work on something your are passionate about, and I acquired data analysis, programming, research and plotting skills without really realising it.
