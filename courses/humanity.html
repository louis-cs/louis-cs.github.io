          This module was all about teaching us the soft skills we would need as an engineer and team leader: in today’s professional world, technical expertise isn’t enough to drive a company forward. A variety of courses were dedicated to such concepts: innovation, team management, social psychology, professional development.

      This module was comprised of six courses, although the Sports course was cancelled because of the pandemic. These courses did not focus on technical skills but rather soft skills, useful regardless of our future job.    </p>

      <p>
        This course was comprised of a series of lectures and group work in relation with our Innovative Project: we were presented the concepts of innovation, briefing, planning and risk management, Every lecture was paired with a group work where we had to work on a specific deliverable for that notion, building a planning document for our innovative project.

        The second part was a social psychology course, mixing lectures, student presentations and even a movie analysis.

    <h2><b>Technical Challenges</b></h2>
  </div>
  <div class="row text-justify">
    <p>
      The technical challenges in this module differ from other modules, as there wasn’t any technical content per say. However, there definitely were challenges  and takeaways.
    </p>
    <h4>Innovation</h4>
    <p>
      This course was the one where we chose our innovative projects and first started analysing the work to be done. The biggest challenges were around taking a step back to analyse and plan our project: understand its requirements, specifications, and defining our goals. Learning to formalise different concepts like planning and risk assessment was also a challenge, but thanks to the help provided by the teacher and working as a group, we delivered a presentation setting the guidelines of our project.    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <a class="btn btn-primary" href="../assets/pdf/innovationprojectslides.pdf">Project Guidelines</a>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="h-divider"></div>
  <div class="row text-justify">
    <h4>Creativity Methods and TRIZ Method</h4>
    <p>
      The main challenge in this course was applying very generic innovation methods to a real life object: glasses. The very essence of this course was to give tools that could be applied to any field or item, but translating these rules into real-life change was definitely challenging. We first had to look through the history of patents submitted for glasses to establish their S-curve, showing the varying rates of innovation. Once we established this pattern, it was easier to take a step back and analyse all the varying ways the object had been improved over time, and look for further improvements using the tools given in class. This hurdle was surmounted by my abstraction and analysis skills, and were a great catalyst for my creative tendencies.    </p>

    <a class="btn btn-primary" href="../assets/pdf/triz.pdf">Glasses Analysis</a>
  </div>
  <div class="h-divider"></div>
  <div class="row text-justify">
    <h4>Team Management</h4>
    <p>
      This course was a very classical one, consisting of lectures and ending with a test. The challenge in the course was to change our way of thinking: we had always worked as a team member, but we are getting a degree to become team leaders. Shifting our point of view was a real challenge, as well as tackling real problems like conflict management or holiday distributions. Applying the lecture’s concepts to real world situations crystallised the notions.    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="h-divider"></div>
  <div class="row text-justify">
    <h4>Social Psychology</h4>
    <p>
      I put this course separately from team management in this section because of how unique it was. One of the biggest challenges was dealing with the different teaching methods: the reverse learning classes required serious research and presentation skill, as well as listening skills to be able to take away as much as possible from every group’s presentation. The movie analysis was also a great way to see social psychology concepts applied to real situations, but required a very high level of attention throughout the movie. On top of acquiring valuable skills in social psychology, this course was a brilliant exercise in diligence and communication.  </div>

  </div>
  <div class="h-divider"></div>
  <div class="row text-justify">
    <h4>Individualised Professional Development</h4>
    <p>
      This course had a very unusual schedule, requiring us to sign up to workshops, then set up a meeting with a volunteer to participate in a mock interview. It required a lot of personal investment and initiative taking, but the results were worth it. The workshops gave me great insight into practical job-searching issues, and the mock interview was the perfect way to evaluate my strengths and weaknesses on the job market. The biggest challenge was meeting the deadlines of having to build job application files amidst an already packed semester, but I ended up meeting them by coupling them with my internship searching schedule, using the folder I constituted for the workshops and interview to send stronger applications to internships.   </div>

    <h2><b>Analysis</b></h2>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
        <p>
        One of INSA’s strengths compared to other engineering schools is the focus on social sciences. Engineers aren’t just technical workers, they need soft skills to manage, lead, and communicate with people. This year’s Innovation and humanity module was a perfect conclusion to the five year cycle of social sciences I received, giving me a variety of practical skills I’m sure to apply in my career.
        <br>
        From the application process to team leading and innovation, the curriculum was both broad enough to cover most fields of my future career and specific enough to teach actual skills I’ll be able to put to use.
